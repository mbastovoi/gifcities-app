                        News Gifizer is a speculative digital resource, that addresses and questions
                        online
                        media outlets.
                        The algorithm is a digital media mapping system. It crawls most popular articles and news,
                        transforms their headlines, word by word, into GIF conglomerates and maps the outcome in
                        multiple
                        windows on the website. The map renews daily.</p>

                    <p>
                        The purpose of the algorithm is to transform popular media headline's words into Geo Cities
                        Archive
                        GIFs - a collection GIFs from the web hosting service websites that was used between 1994-2009.
                        It
                        selects, deconstructs and encodes the popularity based news search results, one of the main
                        components of the current search engines algorithms, into a random visual system, dictated by
                        the
                        user input (the resulted GIFS are resulted from the description in the GIF metadata) from a
                        digital
                        era that we have overcome - a era where search engine optimization and user experience design
                        was
                        not the main concern of site creators.</p>

                    <br>
                    <p>
                        The work argues the epistemology of current mass information outlets, the phenomena of knowledge
                        distribution and hegemony, and the search engines algorithms that facilitate media eurocentrism,
                        racism, classism and others.</p>

                        The work invites its users to dive in the nostalgia of the eccentric and colorful websites of
                        the
                        90s - a period when world wide web just have started to be more accessible to people and was
                        generally perceived optimistically, but also review and question it as a period when its
                        capitalist
                        structures - a snowball of the privilege of the big and authoritative just started to roll,
                        intercalating and enhancing a current advanced post truth and post privacy era. </p>
